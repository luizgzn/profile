                <h3>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</h3>
                <p>Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped
                   the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond
                   the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent
                   weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures.
                   A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way
                   that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

                <h3>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind </h3>
                  <p>In Sapiens, Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very
                    first humans to walk the earth to the radical—and sometimes devastating—breakthroughs of
                    the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology,
                    anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout
                    the text, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals
                    and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded?
                    Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do
                    to influence the course of the centuries to come?

              <td><h3>Meditations</h3>
                  <p>Written in Greek, without any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who was
                    also a philosopher, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer a remarkable series
                    of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand
                    himself and make sense of the universe. Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation,
                    they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence,
                    and Marcus' own emotions.
